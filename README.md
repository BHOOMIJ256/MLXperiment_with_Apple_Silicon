**#MLXperiment with Apple Silicon

A comparative performance study of **MLX vs non-MLX (PyTorch/Keras)** models on Apple Silicon, using both classic and large-scale AI tasks.

##Project Overview

This project aims to analyze how Appleâ€™s **MLX framework** performs relative to conventional ML libraries like **PyTorch** and **Keras**, especially on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips).

We cover:
1. **MNIST classification task** (Approach 1)
2. **Mistral-7B transformer-based model evaluation**
